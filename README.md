# OSA

## Open &amp; Save files from a local filesystem with your web app.

OSA is a simple demo app that lets you open files from your computer into a textarea, edit them and then save them back to your computer.

OSA uses the [File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications) for opening files, and [Downloadify](https://github.com/dcneiner/Downloadify) (Flash) to save files.

Remember to use a web server to serve the app, as the Flash file won't save files due to security restrictions if the app is opened as a local file.
